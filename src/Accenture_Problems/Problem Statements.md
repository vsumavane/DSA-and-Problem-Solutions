## Problem 1

Problem Description :
The function accepts two positive integers ‘r’ and ‘unit’ and a positive integer array ‘arr’ of size ‘n’ as its argument ‘r’ represents the number of rats present in an area, ‘unit’ is the amount of food each rat consumes and each ith element of array ‘arr’ represents the amount of food present in ‘i+1’ house number, where 0 <= i

Note:

Return -1 if the array is null
Return 0 if the total amount of food from all houses is not sufficient for all the rats.
Computed values lie within the integer range.
Example:

Input:
`r: 7
unit: 2
n: 8
arr: 2 8 3 5 7 4 1 2
`

Output:
`4`

Explanation:
Total amount of food required for all rats = r * unit = 7 * 2 = 14.

The amount of food in 1st houses = 2+8+3+5 = 18. Since, amount of food in 1st 4 houses is sufficient for all the rats. Thus, output is 4.

## Problem 2:
(Asked in Accenture OnCampus 10 Aug 2022, Slot 2)

Problem Description :
The Binary number system only uses two digits, 0 and 1 and number system can be called binary string. You are required to implement the following function:

int OperationsBinaryString(char* str);

The function accepts a string str as its argument. The string str consists of binary digits eparated with an alphabet as follows:

– A denotes AND operation
– B denotes OR operation
– C denotes XOR Operation
You are required to calculate the result of the string str, scanning the string to right taking one opearation at a time, and return the same.

Note:

No order of priorities of operations is required
Length of str is odd
If str is NULL or None (in case of Python), return -1
Input:
str: 1C0C1C1A0B1

Output:
1

Explanation:
The alphabets in str when expanded becomes “1 XOR 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 AND 0 OR 1”, result of the expression becomes 1, hence 1 is returned.
## Problem 5

Implement the following Function

def differenceofSum(n. m)

The function accepts two integers n, m as arguments Find the sum of all numbers in range from 1 to m(both inclusive) that are not divisible by n. Return difference between sum of integers not divisible by n with sum of numbers divisible by n.

Assumption:

n>0 and m>0
Sum lies between integral range
Example

Input
n:4
m:20
Output
90

Explanation

Sum of numbers divisible by 4 are 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 = 60
Sum of numbers not divisible by 4 are 1 +2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 150
Difference 150 – 60 = 90
Sample Input
n:3
m:10
Sample Output
19
